# Cipher Clash

A fast-paced code-breaking game where players decode scrambled letters, numbers, or patterns to find hidden words or sequences.

## Game Description

Cipher Clash challenges your code-breaking skills with various types of ciphers:

- **Caesar Cipher**: Letters shifted by a specific amount
- **Substitution Cipher**: Letters replaced with other letters
- **Jumbled Words**: Letters rearranged
- **Morse Code**: Dots and dashes representing letters
- **Binary Code**: Binary or hexadecimal representations

Decode the ciphers as quickly as possible to earn points and advance to more difficult challenges.

## Game Modes

- **Single Player Mode**: Decode as many ciphers as possible before time runs out.
- **Two Player Mode**: Turn-based cipher solving â€” score points based on speed and accuracy.

## Adding Custom Words

You can add your own words to the word bank by editing the `ciphers/word_bank.txt` file. Each word should be on a new line.

## Sound Credits

The game uses the following sound effects:
